Time Series showing Babe Ruth's Homeruns over the Years.
First we must install our libraries.

```{r}
library(Lahman)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggiraph)
```

Next we must create a dataframe:

```{r}
df<-Batting%>%
  filter(playerID=="ruthba01")%>%
  select(yearID,HR)

```

Next we take that dataframe and visualize it:

```{r}
g<-ggplot()+
  geom_line(data=df,aes(x=yearID,y=HR))+
  geom_point_interactive(data=df,aes(x=yearID,y=HR,tooltip=HR,data_id=yearID))
```

Finally, we can make the chart interative by using ggiraph:

```{r}
ggiraph(code=print(g),hover_css="fill=white;stroke=red")
```
